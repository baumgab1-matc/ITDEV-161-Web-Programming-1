# Project 1 Overview

<br>

# Requirement 1 
<li>I am using MongoDB Atlas
<li>NodeJs Express has been installed and is the server for the project

<br>

/students  - lists all students <br>
/students/id - list a specific student <br>
<br>
/courses  - list all courses <br>
/courses/id  - list a specific course <br>

<br>

# Requirement 2

<h2> Description </h2><hr>
For this project I wanted to build something that met the requirements but would also allow me to build on to it in the future. The end goal is to have a react site for some mock school. Where students and professors are able view and edit their courses.  For this project professors were not added but only Students and Courses.

<br>

For project 1 I have set up the backend logic. Though I have react running, I have not done anything with it.  

<br>

Some things I did different were not using esm, though it is installed. I did this mostly because I wanted to do it another way. 

<h2> Feature List </h2><hr>
Routes were a feature I added as almost all tutorials I looked into and threads I read suggest routes as best practice. 

<br>
Database relationships were something I wanted to add. I set it up so Students and Courses have a reference to the other schema.
